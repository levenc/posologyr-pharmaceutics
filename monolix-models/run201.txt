DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a Michaelis-Menten elimination (Vm, Km).


[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {Ka, Vc, Vmax, Km}

EQUATION:
odeType = stiff

ka = Ka
V = Vc
Vm = Vmax
; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(ka, V, Vm, Km)

OUTPUT:
output = Cc
