DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka) and a lag time (Tlag).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).


[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {ALAG, Ka, Vc, Cl}

EQUATION:

; PK model definition
Tlag=ALAG
ka=Ka
V=Vc
Cc = pkmodel(Tlag, ka, V, Cl)

OUTPUT:
output = Cc
