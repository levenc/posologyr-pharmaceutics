DESCRIPTION:
This PK model has a double extravascular absorption composed of
a zero-order absorption (duration Tk01, fraction F1),
and a simultaneous first-order absorption (rate constant ka2, fraction 1-F1).
The PK model has a central compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).
